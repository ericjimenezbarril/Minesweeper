# Minesweeper Game
This repository contains a simple version of the classic Minesweeper game. 

It was developed within a span of two hours during a class session as a demonstration project. 

The implementation aims to provide a basic but functional game experience, highlighting the core mechanics of Minesweeper. 

This project is excellent for understanding the fundamentals of game design and development in a time-constrained setting.
